▶ Difference between recursion and iteration:
	• In recursion, a function calls itself until base condition while in iteration
	we execute same code again and again.
	• For exiting from recursion, we need a base condition but in iteration, we use
	a variable count(like i<n).
	• Iteration is space efficient while recursion is not because in Iteration we 
	does not have any need for stack memory.
	• Iteration is time efficient while recursion is not because recursion 
	need more time to push and pop element from stack memory which makes recursion 
	less time efficient.
	• Recursion is easy to code so we can use recursion in the case we know that 
	problem could be divided in subproblems.
